Title: Words in a String

Description: Words in a String requires a user to enter a word then enter
a string of words and the program will return how many times
that word appears in the string.

I was not able to get the application to work on Chrome.

Set up instructions:
1. In the terminal, type: ruby app.rb and hit "enter."

This will get Sinatra to run.

2. Open a browser and proceed type "localhost:4567" in the browser
   without "".
